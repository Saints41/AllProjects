The file with the name including v10 represents our latest and final term project for our pacemaker project on the Simulink side. In this project, we got a circuit build and were told to program it with DCM(Python) and Simulink. I worked on the Simulink side where we created stateflow diagrams that will program the circuit itself with the help of DCM using serial port connections and on-board pins for electrical pulsing.
