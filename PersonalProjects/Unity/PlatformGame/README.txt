This is my first ever unity game. It is very bare bone and just simple blocks and physics for jumping and collisions. This is used to get a better understanding on the game engine and C# so i can work on the game I initially wanted to.
The library folder contains way too many files so it will not all be uploaded. This means the game cannot be downloaded and play but if you go on my Notion website you will see images and maybe some videos of the game.
